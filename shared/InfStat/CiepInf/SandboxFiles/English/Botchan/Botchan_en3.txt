About twenty steps to the east edge of our garden, there was a moderate-sized vegetable yard, rising toward the south, and in the centre of which stood a chestnut tree which was dearer to me than life.
In the season when the chestnuts were ripe, I used to slip out of the house from the back door early in the morning to pick up the chestnuts which had fallen during the night, and eat them at the school.
On the west side of the vegetable yard was the adjoining garden of a pawn shop called Yamashiro-Ya.
This shopkeeper's son was a boy about 13 or 14 years old named Kantaro.
Kantaro was, it happens, a mollycoddle.
Nevertheless he had the temerity to come over the fence to our yard and steal my chestnuts.
