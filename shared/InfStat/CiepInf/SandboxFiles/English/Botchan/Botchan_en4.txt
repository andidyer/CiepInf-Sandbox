One certain evening I hid myself behind a folding-gate of the fence and caught him in the act.
Having his retreat cut off he grappled with me in desperation. He was about two years older than I, and, though weak-kneed, was physically the stronger.
While I wallopped him, he pushed his head against my breast and by chance it slipped inside my sleeve.
As this hindered the free action of my arm, I tried to shake him loose, though, his head dangled the further inside, and being no longer able to stand the stifling combat, he bit my bare arm.
It was painful.
I held him fast against the fence, and by a dexterous foot twist sent him down flat on his back.
Kantaro broke the fence and as the ground belonging to Yamashiro-ya was about six feet lower than the vegetable yard, he fell headlong to his own territory with a thud.
As he rolled off he tore away the sleeve in which his head had been enwrapped, and my arm recovered a sudden freedom of movement.
That night when my mother went to Yamashiro-Ya to apologize, she brought back that sleeve.
