After the death of mother, I lived with father and brother.
Father did nothing, and always said "You're no good" to my face.
What he meant by "no good" I am yet to understand. A funny dad he was.
My brother was to be seen studying English hard, saying that he was going to be a businessman.
He was like a girl by nature, and so "sassy" that we two were never on good terms, and had to fight it out about once every ten days.
When we played a chess game one day, he placed a chessman as a "waiter,"—a cowardly tactic this,—and had hearty laugh on me by seeing me in a fix.
His manner was so trying that time that I banged a chessman on his forehead which was injured a little bit and bled.
He told all about this to father, who said he would disinherit me.
