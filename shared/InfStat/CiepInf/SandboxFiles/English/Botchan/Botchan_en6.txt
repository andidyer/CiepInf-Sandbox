"He's so reckless that I worry about his future," I often heard mother say of me.
Exactly; I have never amounted to much.
I am just as you see me; no wonder my future used to cause anxiety to my mother.
I am living without becoming but a jailbird.
Two or three days previous to my mother's death, I took it into my head to turn a somersault in the kitchen, and painfully hit my ribs against the corner of the stove.
Mother was very angry at this and told me not to show my face again, so I went to a relative to stay with.
While there, I received the news that my mother's illness had become very serious, and that after all efforts for her recovery, she was dead.
I came home thinking that I should have behaved better if I had known the conditions were so serious as that.
Then that big brother of mine denounced me as wanting in filial piety, and that I had caused her untimely death.
Mortified at this, I slapped his face, and thereupon received a sound scolding from father.
