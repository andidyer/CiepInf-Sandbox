Besides the above, I did many other mischiefs.
With Kaneko of a carpenter shop and Kaku of a fishmarket, I once ruined a carrot patch of one Mosaku.
The sprouts were just shooting out and the patch was covered with straws to ensure their even healthy growth.
Upon this straw-covered patch, we three wrestled for fully half a day, and consequently thoroughly smashed all the sprouts.
Also I once filled up a well which watered some rice fields owned by one Furukawa, and he followed me with kicks.
The well was so devised that from a large bamboo pole, sunk deep into the ground, the water issued and irrigated the rice fields.
Ignorant of the mechanical side of this irrigating method at that time, I stuffed the bamboo pole with stones and sticks, and satisfied that no more water came up, I returned home and was eating supper when Furukawa, fiery red with anger, burst into our house with howling protests.
I believe the affair was settled on our paying for the damage.
Father did not like me in the least, and mother always sided with my big brother.
This brother's face was palish white, and he had a fondness for taking the part of an actress at the theatre.
