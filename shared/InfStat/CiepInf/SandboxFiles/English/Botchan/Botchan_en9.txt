I had long reconciled myself to the fact that my nature was far from being attractive to others, and so didn't mind if I were treated as a piece of wood; so I thought it uncommon that Kiyo should pet me like that.
Sometimes in the kitchen, when there was nobody around, she would praise me saying that I was straightforward and of a good disposition. What she meant by that exactly, was not clear to me, however.
If I were of so good a nature as she said, I imagined those other than Kiyo should accord me a better treatment.
So whenever Kiyo said to me anything of the kind, I used to answer that I did not like passing compliments.
Then she would remark; "That's the very reason I say you are of a good disposition," and would gaze at me with absorbing tenderness.
She seemed to recreate me by her own imagination, and was proud of the fact.
I felt even chilled through my marrow at her constant attention to me.
