The man flung a look back along the way he had come.
The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow.
It was all pure white, rolling in gentle, undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed.
North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island.
This dark hair-line was the trail—the main trail—that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.
