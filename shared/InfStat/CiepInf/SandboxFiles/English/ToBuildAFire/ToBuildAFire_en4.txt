As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively.
There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again.
And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled.
He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air.
Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty belowâ€”how much colder he did not know.
But the temperature did not matter.
He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already.
They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon.
He would be in to camp by six o'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready.
As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket.
It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin.
It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing.
He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.
